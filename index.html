                <p class="articletwopara">773 Concrete Rose is a nonprofit organization founded in 2020 that uses social events to showcase Chicago's talent while simultaneously combating inequality. We use our platform to create positive change around the Chicagoland area. Our mission highlights four main areas: art, education, mentorship, and volunteering. With this project, we hope to expand our brand as one of the most prominent nonprofits in Chicago.</p>

                <h2 id="articletwotitle2" class="articletitles"><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> Mentorship <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i></h2>
                <p class="articletwopara">Mentors can be beneficial in providing a support system that understands your goals and is willing to help you achieve them. Mentorship is for people of all ages to promote professional and personal growth. Concrete Rose Chicago created a mentorship program to help encourage this growth. This mentorship application is designed to match mentors and mentees of similar interests, geographical location, communication styles, and career goals. The mentorship application for August 2022 - December 2022 will open on July 1, 2022. Following December 31, 2022, pairings can be changed or remain the same based on the interest of both the mentor and mentee. Please be on the lookout for the upcoming application! The application will take 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>

                <h2 id="articletwotitle3" class="articletitles">Volunteering <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i></h2>
                <p class="articletwopara">Concrete Rose Chicago has hosted a series of volunteering events in the past ranging from feeding the less fortunate, to charity basketball games, and fashion shows. Check our page and social media platforms for updates on upcoming events.</p>

                <p>In May 2020, with the help of friends and family, Concrete Rose Chicago shipped and packed over 250 lunch bags and sent them around the city. Our goal with this project was to give back to the city that helped shape us into the individuals we are. We believe that everyone deserves necessities, and giving out these bags full of food and essentials allowed us to assist many of those who don't have access to these necessities. This has since become a monthly initiative.</p>
