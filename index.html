                <p id="articlefourpara">Born and Raised on the south side of Chicago, Darrin Cotton Jr (Executive Director) is a former student-athlete at Davenport University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. DJ is also an alum of Gwendolyn Brooks College Prep, located in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago. DJ Cotton received his Bachelor's in Sports Management and Business in April 2023. DJ has seen everything the city has to offer. Being from Chicago has been a huge blessing for DJ, and as a result of the culture, experiences, and ability to collaborate with like-minded individuals, it has opened his eyes to the fact that, oftentimes, individuals need a platform to showcase their talents. Therefore, Concrete Rose aims to provide a life-changing platform for Chicago's youth. More specifically, we aim to spotlight Chicago's youth with hopes of turning those talents into life-long careers. Thus far, Dj has led numerous events in the Chicagoland area to give back to the community and showcase the talents of the under-represented stars of Chicago.</p>

                <p class="articletwopara">773 Concrete Rose is a nonprofit organization founded in 2020 that uses social events to showcase Chicago's talent while simultaneously combating inequality. We use our platform to create positive change around the Chicagoland area. Our mission highlights four main areas: art, education, mentorship, and volunteering. With this project, we hope to expand our brand as one of the most prominent nonprofits in Chicago.</p>

                <h2 id="articletwotitle2" class="articletitles"><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> Mentorship <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i></h2>
                <p class="articletwopara">Mentors can be beneficial in providing a support system that understands your goals and is willing to help you achieve them. Mentorship is for people of all ages to promote professional and personal growth. Concrete Rose Chicago created a mentorship program to help encourage this growth. This mentorship application is designed to match mentors and mentees of similar interests, geographical location, communication styles, and career goals. The mentorship application for August 2022 - December 2022 will open on July 1, 2022. Following December 31, 2022, pairings can be changed or remain the same based on the interest of both the mentor and mentee. Please be on the lookout for the upcoming application! The application will take 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 id="articletwotitle3" class="articletitles">Volunteering <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i></h2>
